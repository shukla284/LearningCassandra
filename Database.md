# Cassandra

### Relational Databases
The simplest of the database ideas that come up in the mind while we think of it, is mostly the relational database. This very familiarity can be attributed to the simplicity of the how the data is being handled in such databases. The most common example being of the MySQL which is one of the fastest such implementations of SQL and power up many of the transaction in the software industry. 

### Evolving Data and Database evolution

* Now the things are becoming more and more complex day by day, data is not following a single kind of pattern anywhere and with the advancements of industry the data is being more and more versatile and varied. Then another classification did happened in terms of relational that is SQL, and another being NoSQL which was having additional features which are more optimized towards storing different kinds of data, handling that too at the submilisecond latencies. 

### Storage of data in Cassandra
* Cassandra is one of the modern NoSQL databases which is column oriented databases and that is more suited for the data which is more sparse in the relational databases. It stores the data in the form of the rows and columns while this time the columns are fixed and they are mostly, (id, attribute name, attribute value); now the columns in the relational database is transformed to the rows and the values being stored in the another column.

* Stores the database (key, values) in form of the id key and the name value pairs are stored corresponding to the values. 
* Data types or use cases like catalogues or the data where there is lesser similiarity with the data models of the different entities or the types of the data which we are storing into the database. 

### Cassandra being better than Relational Databases
* Where the relational databases would have wasted much space due to such sparse data being stored, cassandra performs well here since there comes more optimization with that kind of the databases. Now since this database is having such an arrangement for storing the data, it results into more effciency with the databases. 

* Another advantage other than the storage of the data is that cassandra is distributed. Having capacity to handle a lot of the requests rate cassandra is not centralized kind of system. The distributed nature of cassandra helps here since that helps with the things like scaling out the database with the requirement at such a high scale. 

* Cassandra is one of the great databases which are being extensively used in the industry and it can scale and tune with the correct consistency as required.
